## ⚠️ Important First-Time Form Setup

**CRITICAL**: When you first deploy and someone submits a form:

1. FormSubmit sends you a **confirmation email** to ArashShn@gmail.com
2. You MUST **click the activation link** in that email
3. After clicking, that specific form is activated forever
4. Repeat for each of the 3 forms (Contact, Quotes, Books)

**Recommendation**: After deployment, submit a test from each form yourself to activate them all.
